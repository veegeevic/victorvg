I build websites that feel intuitive on the surface and dependable underneath.

I enjoy translating complex problems websites that people can actually understand and use—regardless of device, ability, or context.

Over the past years, I’ve:

- **Collaborated closely with design and engineering** to shape end‑to‑end experiences, from discovery to delivery.
- **Implemented design systems** that keep interfaces consistent and accessible at scale.
- **Created accessible environments**, working with teams to bake accessibility into definition, design, and development—not bolt it on at the end.

### How I work

I like to work in small, visible iterations:

- Start from **real user needs** and constraints, not just feature requests.
- Explore multiple directions quickly, then **narrow with evidence**—prototypes, tests, or data.
- Document flows and decisions clearly so that handoff to engineering is **predictable rather than painful**.
- Pair with developers to ensure that what ships matches the intent, especially for **states, edge cases, and accessibility**.

### Outside of work

I allocate a significant portion of my unstructured time to repetitive, self-inflicted aerobic stress in the form of cycling, running, and swimming. 🏃🚴🏊
